// Can be get from Producer Config mentioned in Apache Kafka documentation
// Create Producer Properties

// Create the producer

// Create ProducerRecord
// In ProducerRecord we can mention which Topic, Partition, Key, Value it need to go

// Send Data
===============================
For producer 'acks' are very important
acks=0 (no acks) - If broker goes offline  or exception happen we wont know and loose data
acks=1 : default as of kafka 2.0 : leaders acks guranteed but replication is not a gurantee, if ack is not received producer may retry
acks=all : Both leader and replica need to acknowledge

- With acks=all, must also use "min.insync.replicas" : Can be set at broker or topic level
- min.insync.replicas=2, implies that atleast 2 broker that are ISR(Include leader) must respond that they have data
- If you use replication.factor=3, min.insync=2, acks=all, then you can only tolerate 1(one) broker going down otherwise producer will
receive an exception in send
- Exception thrown would be "NOT_ENOUGH_REPLICAS"
