Transactions and Commit Logs
- Are source of truth
- Physically stored and maintained
- Higher order data structures derive from log:
	-: Tables, Indexes, Views etc.
- It can also be used in point of recovery

------------------------------------------------
- Apache Kafka is publish/subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed commit log
- Each topic has one or more partitions
- Partition = Log
- .log and .index file will be created in broker at : /tmp/kafka-logs/{topic}-{partition}
- Sample : /tmp/kafka-logs/my_topic-0 : It contains log for single partition
- Each partition must fit entirely on one machine
- In general, the scalability of Apache Kafka is determined by the number of partitions being managed by multiple broker nodes
