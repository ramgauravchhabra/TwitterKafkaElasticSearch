Health of Elastic Search Cluster
# /_cat/health?v

Number of nodes
# /_cat/nodes?v

- Indices is where we store data in Elastic Search

Number of Indicies available to me in cluster
# /_cat/indices?v
Initially when we dont have any of our indicies available then result is below which includes system indices
Answer to above query: health status index uuid pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size

Create Indicies to store our data
# Choose 'PUT'
# /twitter

- We need to insert records as 'documents' and in the form of JSON
- To insert we need index/type/id like twitter/tweets/1
